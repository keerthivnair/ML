## This repo consists of implementation of Machine Learning algorithms I implemented both from scratch and using sklearn and a project for each topic-wise with data cleaning and model accuracy predictions for each.

### The datasets were used from kaggle - Titanic dataset etc and some imported from seaborn.

 Here are some of the deployed project links to checkout.
